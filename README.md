## Overview

This is a simple ReactJS + NodeJS project made with the current functionalities:

1. Login/logout based on an endpoint
2. Realtime map with markers based on endpoint item localization
3. Context API
4. React Router DOM

I had an external backend with authentication working and I had to make a login handler and also only show api items if the user was authenticated.

Since this API is not hosted by me, it can be offline by the time you enter here to take a look but the code is always here so go check it out :)

## How to run

1. Change both .envtemplate to .env from server and client folder and type the API url.
2. Run `npm run dev` in the root folder and it will run both server and client with `concurrently`.
3. Enjoy ðŸ˜Š
